    <p>Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Fourplay,
      Four in a Row and Four in a Line) is a two-player connection game in which the players
      first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column,
      six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available
      space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of
      the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.</p>
